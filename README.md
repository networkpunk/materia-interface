# materia-interface

## What is it?

A basic React user interface I made for practice.

## What it does?

Renders a basic UI, constisting of a navigation bar component with links to other pages in the app.

## How does it do it?

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the environment
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for CSS styling
- [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) for the links/routes
